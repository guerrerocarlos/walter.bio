Is helpful to run your own Jenkins instance to test your jobs and pipelines. Docker and docker-compose make this task doable in a few of steps.

My recommendation is to prepare `Dockerfile` that inherits from the official Jenkins docker image, and customize the packages and jenkins plugins that you want to use.

## Clone and Run

1.  Clone the repository

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:waltervargas/jenkins.git
    ```

2. Run

    ```sh
    cd jenkins
    docker-compose up
    ```

3.  Go to <http://localhost:8080/>
