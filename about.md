I have around 15 years of experience playing different roles: system engineer,
advisor, and leader. My expertise has been shaped mainly by the people in my
path, from lovely to demanding customers, passionate computists to non-technical
people in strategic positions with mission-critical projects and human lives
under their responsibility.

I reckon we are living in times of infinite opportunities, and at the same time,
there is a great responsibility of unleashing the power of technology for the
benefit of all living beings.

I admire the contribution of Amazon Web Services is making to humankind and the
environment through Cloud Computing. I believe Amazon is playing an essential
role in the future of our civilization by reinventing the Computer Industry
oriented to save resources and give everyone the chance to make wise choices as
a society by solving global problems, this is the main reason of why I decided
to join Amazon as the best path for me to be part of the positive change I want
to see happen in the world.

I appreciate your time reading this, thank you, please let me know your thoughts
in form of comments below.
