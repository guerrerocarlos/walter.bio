Unleashing the power of knowledge to give us the chance to make wise choices as
a society for the benefit of all living beings and be part of the positive
change I want to the world is what keeps my heart beating.

I have around 15 years of experience playing different roles: developer, system
engineer, advisor, CEO. My expertise has been shaped mainly by the people in my
path, from lovely to demanding customers, passionate computer scientists to
non-technical people in C-level positions with mission-critical business process
impacting millions of citizens under their responsibility.

I reckon we are living in times of infinite opportunities, and at the same time,
there is a great responsibility of unleashing the power of knowledge for the
benefit of all living beings.

I appreciate your time reading this, thank you, please let me know your thoughts
